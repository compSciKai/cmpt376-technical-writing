# Formal Education in Technical Writing

Most of this repo uses material covered in CMPT376, a course covered professional writing in computing science, including format conventions and technical reports. Attention was paid to group dynamics, including team leadership, dispute resolution, cognitive bias, professional ethics and collaborative writing. Research methods, and control tools such as LaTeX were used and discussed. The textbook for course was TODO:Link

More information about the CMPT376 course can be found here: TODO:Link

## Benefit to learning technical writing formally

CMPT376 had a heavy course load of writing activities, and in completion of these writing activities I've learned to firstly create rough drafts of writing content quickly, allowing for more creative forms of communication, and secondly learned to revise materials 

## Applications in Technical Writing

Notible projects in CMPT376 included editting and revising a published research paper (Here TODO:Link)

During this course, another writing course was conducted concurrently, called CMNS130, Communication and Social Change; In CMNS130 I used methods learned in CMPT376, and earned grades above the class average, and earned 92% on my final project. The final project was a 2100 word essay worth 30% of the grade, and found here: TODO:Link

In addition to these in-school applications to technical writing, I often use what I have learned in writing quick and concise README files in each of my Github repositories.
