# Formal Education in Technical Writing

Most of this repo uses material covered in CMPT376, a course covered professional writing in computing science, including format conventions and technical reports. Attention was paid to group dynamics, including team leadership, dispute resolution, cognitive bias, professional ethics and collaborative writing. Research methods, and control tools such as LaTeX were used and discussed. The textbook for course was TODO:Link

During this course, I received a final grade above the class average, and most assignments received A grades.

## Benefit to learning technical writing formally

CMPT376 had a heavy course load of writing activities. In completion of these writing activities I've learned to firstly create rough drafts of writing content quickly, allowing for more creative forms of communication, and secondly learned to revise materials to ensure content is written most effectively. 

## Applications in Technical Writing

Notible projects in CMPT376 included revising a published research paper, peer revisions, real world revision applications, individual technical reports, and a writing journal. The writing journal had writing activities needing completion every 3 days. 

Links to projects are found here:

- Research Paper Revisions
- Peer Revisions
- Real world edits (revisions)
- Technical Report 1
- Technical Report 2
- Writing Journal

### Writing for Communication and Social Change

During this course, another writing course was conducted concurrently, called CMNS130, Communication and Social Change; In CMNS130 I used methods learned in CMPT376, and earned grades above the class average, and earned 92% on my final project. The final project was a 2100 word essay worth 30% of the grade, and found here: TODO:Link

### Writing for Github Readme Files

In addition to these in-school applications to technical writing, I often use what I have learned in writing quick and concise README files in each of my Github repositories. I've found writing is often supplimentary to visual communication, and aim to include Gifs for each of my Github projects. Personally consuming media visually (opposed to written), can often communicate a message much more effectively than a written description, so including both visual and written content is the most effective form of communication.
