# Formal Education in Technical Writing

Most of this repo uses material covered in CMPT376, a course covering professional writing in computing science, including format conventions and technical reports. Attention was paid to group dynamics, including team leadership, dispute resolution, cognitive bias, professional ethics and collaborative writing. Research methods, and control tools such as LaTeX were used and discussed. The textbook for this course was [Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Williams-Style-Lessons-in-Clarity-and-Grace-12th-Edition/9780134080413.html)

During this course, I received a final grade above the class average, and most of my assignments received an A grade ([proof here](grades.md)).

## Benefit to Learning Technical Writing Formally

CMPT376 had a heavy course load of writing activities. In completion of these activities, I've learned to firstly create rough drafts of writing content quickly, allowing for more creative forms of writing, and secondly learned to revise materials to ensure content is written most effectively. 

## Applications in Technical Writing

Notible projects in CMPT376 included revising a published research paper, peer revisions, real world revision applications, individual technical reports, and a writing journal. In the Real World Revisions assignment, I choose 60 Github repos to make edits on written content. Many repo owners implemented revisions. Peer revisions were conducted on technical reports 1 & 2 (below). The writing journal had writing activities roughly every 3 days.

### Writing for Communication and Social Change

During CMPT376, another writing course was conducted concurrently, called CMNS130, Communication and Social Change; In CMNS130 I used methods learned in CMPT376, and earned grades above the class average, and earned 92% on my final project. The final project was a 2444 word essay worth 30% of the grade, and found here: [CMPT130 Final Paper](https://github.com/compSciKai/cmpt376-technical-writing/blob/main/CMNS130%20-%20Final%20Paper.pdf)

### Writing for Reports in Affective Computing

[Deep Dive Research Paper: Curiosity](https://github.com/compSciKai/cmpt376-technical-writing/blob/main/Deep_Dive_Research_Paper.pdf) This paper was used in CMPT419: Affective Computing, taking place after my studies in CMPT376. Please excuse the formatting. LaTeX is weird. 

### Writing for Github Readme Files

In addition to these in-school applications to technical writing, I often use what I have learned in writing quick and concise README files in each of my Github repositories. I've found writing is often supplementary to visual communication, and aim to include Gifs for each of my Github projects. In my opinion, consuming media visually (opposed to written), can often communicate a message much more effectively than a written description. I aim to use both. 

## Interest in Writing, and Touch Typing

Learning to touch type has vastly increased my writing interest and writing ability. I've learned to type at 85 WPM. Looking at a keyboard as you type limits writing creativity; thinking of what to write, and then looking at a keyboard to type makes your brain switch between logical tasks, breaking train of thought. Being able to think of something to write, and writing it at the same time, not only makes writing quicker, but the brain does not need to actively think about what to type next; the context switch is virtually eliminated, and creative writing can occur unimpeded. 

I would recommend learning to touch type to anyone, especially since more of our productivity is conducted through computers everyday. I recommend finding a touch typing program and practicing touch typing 20 minutes a day.
