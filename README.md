# Formal Education in Technical Writing

Most of this repo uses material covered in CMPT376, a course covering professional writing in computing science, including format conventions and technical reports. Attention was paid to group dynamics, including team leadership, dispute resolution, cognitive bias, professional ethics and collaborative writing. Research methods, and control tools such as LaTeX were used and discussed. The textbook for course was [Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Williams-Style-Lessons-in-Clarity-and-Grace-12th-Edition/9780134080413.html)

During this course, I received a final grade above the class average, and most of my assignments received an A grade ([proof here](grades.md)). 

More information about the CMPT376 course can be found here: [CMPT376 Fall 2019](http://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2019/fall/cmpt/376w/d100)

## Benefit to Learning Technical Writing Formally

CMPT376 had a heavy course load of writing activities. In completion of these activities, I've learned to firstly create rough drafts of writing content quickly, allowing for more creative forms of writing, and secondly learned to revise materials to ensure content is written most effectively. 

## Applications in Technical Writing

Notible projects in CMPT376 included revising a published research paper, peer revisions, real world revision applications, individual technical reports, and a writing journal. In the Real World Revisions assignment, I choose 60 Github repos to make edits on written content. Many repo owners implemented revisions. Peer revisions were conducted on technical reports 1 & 2 (below). The writing journal had writing activities roughly every 3 days.

### Writing for Communication and Social Change

During CMPT376, another writing course was conducted concurrently, called CMNS130, Communication and Social Change; In CMNS130 I used methods learned in CMPT376, and earned grades above the class average, and earned 92% on my final project. The final project was a 2444 word essay worth 30% of the grade, and found here: [CMPT130 - Final Paper](https://github.com/compSciKai/cmpt376-technical-writing/blob/main/CMNS130%20-%20Final%20Paper.pdf)

### Writing for Reports in Affective Computing

[Deep Dive Research Paper: Curiosity](https://github.com/compSciKai/cmpt376-technical-writing/blob/main/Deep_Dive_Research_Paper.pdf) This paper was used in CMPT419: Affective Computing which followed my studies in CMPT376. Please excuse the formatting. Latex is weird. 

### Writing for Github Readme Files

In addition to these in-school applications to technical writing, I often use what I have learned in writing quick and concise README files in each of my Github repositories. I've found writing is often supplimentary to visual communication, and aim to include Gifs for each of my Github projects. In my opinion, consuming media visually (opposed to written), can often communicate a message much more effectively than a written description. I aim to use both.
